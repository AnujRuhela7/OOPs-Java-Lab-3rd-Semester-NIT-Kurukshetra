When we override the `equals()` method in a Java class, it's a best practice (and recommended by the Java language specification) to also override the `hashCode()` method. This ensures that two objects considered equal by the `equals()` method will also have the same hash code, which is important when objects are used in collections like `HashMap`, `HashSet`, and `HashTable`.

### Overriding the `hashCode()` Method for the `Dog` Class

```java
    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        int result = 17; 
        result = 31 * result + name.hashCode(); 
        result = 31 * result + says.hashCode();
        return result; 
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the `hashCode()` Method

1. **Initial Hash Value:**
   ```java
   int result = 17;
   ```
    - We start with a non-zero constant (in this case, `17`). The choice of `17` is arbitrary, but it's a common convention to start with a small prime number to reduce hash collisions.

2. **Computing Hash for the `name` Attribute:**
   ```java
   result = 31 * result + name.hashCode();
   ```
    - This line computes the hash code for the `name` attribute and combines it with the current hash (`result`).
    - `31` is another prime number, chosen to create a unique distribution of hash codes. The choice of `31` is based on its performance in hash tables due to its properties of being an odd prime number, which minimizes collisions.
    - `name.hashCode()` invokes the `hashCode()` method of the `String` class to get the hash code of the `name` attribute.

3. **Computing Hash for the `says` Attribute:**
   ```java
   result = 31 * result + says.hashCode();
   ```
    - Similarly, this line computes the hash code for the `says` attribute and adds it to the current hash (`result`).
    - Again, the prime number `31` is used to ensure a good distribution of hash codes.
    - `says.hashCode()` invokes the `hashCode()` method of the `String` class to get the hash code of the `says` attribute.

4. **Return the Final Hash Code:**
   ```java
   return result;
   ```
    - After combining the hash codes of all the significant fields (`name` and `says`), the final hash code is returned.

### Why Override `hashCode()`?

- **Consistency with `equals()`:** If two objects are considered equal (`equals()` returns `true`), they must have the same hash code. This consistency is necessary to ensure that objects work correctly in hash-based collections like `HashMap` and `HashSet`.
- **Performance Improvement:** By providing a good implementation of `hashCode()`, the performance of hash-based collections improves, as the distribution of hash codes affects how elements are stored and retrieved.

### Summary

- The overridden `hashCode()` method calculates a unique hash code based on the `name` and `says` attributes.
- The use of prime numbers (like `31`) helps create a wide and efficient distribution of hash codes.
- Always override `hashCode()` whenever `equals()` is overridden to maintain consistency and ensure proper functioning of hash-based collections in Java.
