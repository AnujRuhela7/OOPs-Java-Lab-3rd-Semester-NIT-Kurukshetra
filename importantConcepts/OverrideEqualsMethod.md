### Overridden `equals()` Method in Detail

```java
@Override
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    if (this == obj) {
        return true; 
    }
    if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) {
        return false;
    }
    Dog otherDog = (Dog) obj; 
    return name.equals(otherDog.name) && says.equals(otherDog.says);
}
```

#### Explanation

1. **`@Override` Annotation:**
   ```java
   @Override
   ```
    - This annotation indicates that the `equals()` method is being overridden from its definition in the `Object` class.
    - The `equals()` method is defined in the `Object` class, and every Java class inherits it by default. Overriding it allows us to customize the equality comparison for `Dog` objects based on their attributes.

2. **Method Signature:**
   ```java
   public boolean equals(Object obj) {
   ```
    - This is the method signature for the overridden `equals()` method. It takes a single parameter, `obj`, of type `Object`, which is the object to be compared with the current instance (`this`).
    - The method returns a boolean value (`true` or `false`) indicating whether the two objects are considered equal based on their content.

3. **Reference Check:**
   ```java
   if (this == obj) {
       return true; // If both references point to the same object
   }
   ```
    - This line checks if the current object (`this`) and the object passed as a parameter (`obj`) are the same by comparing their references using the `==` operator.
    - If both references point to the same memory location (i.e., they are the exact same object in memory), then they are considered equal, and the method returns `true`.

4. **Null and Class Check:**
   ```java
   if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) {
       return false; // If the object is null or not of the same class
   }
   ```
    - The first part of this check, `obj == null`, ensures that the method does not throw a `NullPointerException` if `obj` is `null`. If `obj` is `null`, the objects cannot be equal, so it returns `false`.
    - The second part, `getClass() != obj.getClass()`, checks whether the `obj` is of the same class as the current instance (`this`).
        - `getClass()` returns the runtime class of the object. If the runtime classes of `this` and `obj` are different, they cannot be equal, so the method returns `false`.
    - Together, these checks ensure that we are comparing objects of the same type, and that `obj` is not `null`.

5. **Type Casting:**
   ```java
   Dog otherDog = (Dog) obj; // Type casting to compare attributes
   ```
    - If the checks in the previous lines pass, it is safe to cast `obj` to a `Dog` type.
    - `Dog otherDog = (Dog) obj;` casts `obj` from `Object` to `Dog`, allowing us to access the `name` and `says` attributes of the `obj` object for further comparison.
    - This type casting is necessary because `equals()` takes an `Object` as a parameter, but to compare the attributes, we need to work with `Dog` objects.

6. **Attribute Comparison:**
   ```java
   return name.equals(otherDog.name) && says.equals(otherDog.says);
   ```
    - This line compares the attributes of the current `Dog` object (`this`) with the attributes of the `otherDog` object (the casted version of `obj`).
    - `name.equals(otherDog.name)` compares the `name` attribute of the current `Dog` with the `name` attribute of the other `Dog`.
    - `says.equals(otherDog.says)` compares the `says` attribute of the current `Dog` with the `says` attribute of the other `Dog`.
    - The `&&` operator ensures that both attribute comparisons must return `true` for the `equals()` method to return `true`.
    - If both `name` and `says` are equal, the method returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

### Summary

- **`this == obj`**: Checks if both references point to the same object.
- **`obj == null`**: Ensures the object being compared is not `null`.
- **`getClass() != obj.getClass()`**: Checks that both objects are of the same class.
- **`Dog otherDog = (Dog) obj;`**: Casts the object to `Dog` for attribute comparison.
- **`name.equals(otherDog.name) && says.equals(otherDog.says)`**: Compares the actual content of both `Dog` objects to determine equality.

By overriding the `equals()` method, we provide a way to compare two `Dog` objects based on their attribute values (`name` and `says`), rather than their memory references.
