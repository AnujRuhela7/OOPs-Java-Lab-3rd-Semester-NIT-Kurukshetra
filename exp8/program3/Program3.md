1. **Interfaces:**
    - `EngineControl`, `ACControl`, and `MusicControl` define methods to control the car's engine, air conditioning, and music system.
    - `CarControl` extends the three interfaces and adds a `checkCarStatus()` method to display the overall status.

2. **Concrete Class `Vehicle`:**
    - This class contains a `speed` attribute and a method `getSpeed()` to return the car's current speed.

3. **Implementing Class `SmartCar`:**
    - `SmartCar` inherits from `Vehicle` and implements the `CarControl` interface. It overrides the methods from all interfaces to control the engine, AC, and music. It also implements the `checkCarStatus()` method to print the current status of the car's components (engine, AC, music) and its speed.

4. **Class `CarController`:**
    - This class contains four methods, each taking an interface (`EngineControl`, `ACControl`, `MusicControl`, `CarControl`) as an argument to demonstrate control over the different car systems.

5. **Main Method:**
    - In the `main()` method, an object of `SmartCar` is created with an initial speed of 60 km/h. The `CarController` class is used to control the engine, AC, music, and check the car’s overall status

This solution demonstrates how the car’s various systems can be controlled via interfaces and ensures that the overall car status, including the speed, can be checked.


In your scenario, the methods in the `CarController` class accept arguments of types `EngineControl`, `ACControl`, `MusicControl`, and `CarControl`. These are **interfaces** that define specific sets of methods, and the class `SmartCar` implements all of them.

### Why does passing a `SmartCar` object to these methods work?

The key idea here is **polymorphism** in Java. When an object of a class (like `SmartCar`) implements multiple interfaces, it can be passed as an argument to methods expecting any of those interfaces.

Here’s why it works:

1. **`SmartCar` Implements All Interfaces:**
   The `SmartCar` class implements the interfaces `EngineControl`, `ACControl`, `MusicControl`, and `CarControl`. Therefore, it inherits all the methods defined in those interfaces. In Java, when a class implements an interface, objects of that class can be treated as objects of the interface type.

2. **Polymorphism at Work:**
   Since the `SmartCar` class implements these interfaces, it can be passed to any method expecting one of those interface types. For example:
    - The method `controlEngine(EngineControl engine)` accepts an argument of type `EngineControl`. Since `SmartCar` implements `EngineControl`, a `SmartCar` object can be passed to this method, even though `SmartCar` also implements other interfaces.
    - Similarly, `SmartCar` can be passed to methods expecting `ACControl`, `MusicControl`, or `CarControl` because it implements all these interfaces.

3. **Interface Type in Method Signature:**
   When you pass a `SmartCar` object to a method like `controlEngine(EngineControl engine)`, even though the method signature expects an `EngineControl`, the object passed can be of any class (like `SmartCar`) that implements `EngineControl`. The method can only call the methods defined in the `EngineControl` interface on that object, but the actual object passed (`SmartCar`) contains the implementation of those methods.

### Let's break it down with an example:

Suppose you have the following method in `CarController`:

```java
public void controlEngine(EngineControl engine) {
    engine.startEngine();
    engine.stopEngine();
}
```

And this is your `SmartCar` class:

```java
class SmartCar extends Vehicle implements CarControl {
    // SmartCar implements all methods of CarControl, EngineControl, ACControl, MusicControl
}
```

In the `main()` method, you pass a `SmartCar` object to `controlEngine`:

```java
SmartCar myCar = new SmartCar(60);
CarController controller = new CarController();

controller.controlEngine(myCar);  // This works!
```

**Why does this work?**
- The `controlEngine` method expects an object of type `EngineControl`.
- The `SmartCar` class implements `EngineControl` (along with other interfaces), so it can be passed to the method.
- At runtime, Java knows that the `myCar` object has the `startEngine()` and `stopEngine()` methods because `SmartCar` implements `EngineControl`, even though `myCar` is more than just an `EngineControl` object.

### What Happens Internally?

1. The method `controlEngine(EngineControl engine)` expects an object that implements `EngineControl`.
2. You pass a `SmartCar` object, which satisfies this requirement because `SmartCar` implements `EngineControl`.
3. Inside the method, even though `SmartCar` has more methods and attributes, only the methods defined in the `EngineControl` interface (`startEngine()` and `stopEngine()`) are accessible in that method.
4. Java handles this smoothly because of polymorphism—the `SmartCar` object is treated as an instance of the `EngineControl` interface within the scope of the method.

### Recap of Key Points:
- **Polymorphism** allows a class like `SmartCar` to be passed as an argument to methods expecting any of the interfaces it implements.
- The object is treated as the type of the interface within the method, even though it might have additional methods and properties.
- You don’t need to explicitly pass the "right" interface type as long as the object implements that interface. The object (like `SmartCar`) can be passed, and Java will handle it correctly based on the interface methods.
